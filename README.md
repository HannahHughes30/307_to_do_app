## Contributing

To maintain a consistent code style across the project, we are using the following tools:

1. **ESLint** for JavaScript and React linting

   - ESLint will flag programming errors, style issues, and unused variables.

2. **Prettier** for automatic code formatting

---

## IDE Plugin Setup

To avoid manual formatting and linting:

1. Install the Prettier plugin for your IDE (e.g., VSCode). This will format your code on save.
2. Install the ESLint plugin. This will show linting errors/warnings instantly as you type.
